*-Maybe change IdentityOptionsProvider file location

-Add Automapper

-Implement automapper functionality for products, cart, users, genders, roles

-Add Validation for login and register

-Fix the quantity js script functionality by adding quantity change for product cart with <input type="Hidden"> and some js code.

-Add security features(aka unauthorized users cant visit etc... Normal User can't visit admin pages etc...). Maybe do it by implementing your own validation attribute...
